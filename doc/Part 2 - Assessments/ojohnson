I constucted the UML based on user stories and a personal rough mock-up. I also added to the glossary and provided
input on the mock-up/story board. 

Reviews: 

General: Better communication is a must, it wasn't terrible for having just begun the group but we all need to be more 
open with the progress we have made on each assigned task. Breaking down the user stories further will be important going forward to help 
better relegate tasks
