### Self Assessment
- I worked on preparing the product backlog with Justine and Ridwan.
- This included understanding what stories meant and what is their significance in regards to forming a product backlog.
- Also, learned about story points, risk level and rationale.
- The stories that were broken down and analysed in terms of risk-level were then put to github project here: https://github.com/CMPUT301W20T20/CabMe/projects/1
